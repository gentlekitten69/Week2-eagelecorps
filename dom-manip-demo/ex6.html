Exercise 6: Simple Word Guess
Objective: Basic string manipulation and comparison.

Prepare a list of words in a JavaScript array.
Create an HTML page with an input box and a "Guess" button.
The user should guess the word. After a guess, inform the user if they're correct or not.
For added complexity, show a hint (e.g., "It's a fruit").
